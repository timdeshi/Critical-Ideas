# Program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers

# Ask the user to input two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number (num1): "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number (num2): "))

# Calculate the multiplication
multiplication = num1 * num2

# Calculate the division
division = num1 / num2

# Display the results
print(f"The multiplication of {num1} and {num2} is: {multiplication}")
print(f"The division of {num1} by {num2} is: {division}")
